      Liability for content
    </h2>
    <p class="text-base leading-7 font-medium">
      The contents of our pages have been created with the greatest care.
      However, we cannot assume any liability for the accuracy, completeness and
      topicality of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for
      our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 para. 1 TMG (German
      Telemedia Act) and general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we
      as a service provider are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored
      third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate
      illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in
      accordance with general legislation remain unaffected by this. However,
      liability in this respect is only possible from the time of knowledge of a
      specific infringement.

      Liability for links
    </h2>
    <p class="text-base leading-7 font-medium">
      Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose
      content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot accept any liability
      for this third-party content. The respective provider or operator of the
      pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The
      linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of
      linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking.
      However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not
      reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. If we become
      aware of any legal infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
