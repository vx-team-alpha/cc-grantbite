      Recipients of personal data
    </h3>

    <p class="font-medium text-base leading-7">
      As part of our business activities, we work together with various external
      bodies. In some cases, it is also necessary to transfer personal data to
      these external bodies. We only pass on personal data to external bodies if
      this is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally
      obliged to do so (e.g. passing on data to tax authorities), if we have a
      legitimate interest in the transfer in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit.
      f GDPR or if another legal basis permits the transfer of data. When using
      processors, we only pass on our customers' personal data on the basis of a
      valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a
      joint processing agreement is concluded.

      OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE
      ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO

      the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we generally need time to
      verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request
      that the processing of your personal data be restricted. If the processing
      of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of
      data processing instead of erasure.

      If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise,
      defense or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the

      restriction of the processing of your personal data. If you have
      restricted the processing of your personal data, this data - apart from
      its storage - may only be processed with your consent or for the
      establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection
      of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of

    </h3>

    <p class="font-medium text-base leading-7">
      If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we
      require an e-mail address from you as well as information that allows us
      to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address provided and that
      you agree to receive the newsletter. No further data is collected, or only
      on a voluntary basis. We use this data exclusively for sending the
      requested information and do not pass it on to third parties. The data
      entered in the newsletter registration form is processed exclusively on
      the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke
      your consent to the storage of the data, the e-mail address and its use
      for sending the newsletter at any time, for example via the "Unsubscribe"
      link in the newsletter. The legality of the data processing operations
      that have already taken place remains unaffected by the revocation.
    </p>

    <p class="font-medium text-base leading-7">
      The data you provide us with for the purpose of subscribing to the
      newsletter will be stored by us or the newsletter service provider until
      you unsubscribe from the newsletter and deleted from the newsletter
      distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter or after the
      purpose no longer applies. We reserve the right to delete or block e-mail
      addresses from our newsletter distribution list at our own discretion
      within the scope of our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6
      para. 1 lit. f GDPR.
    </p>

    <p class="font-medium text-base leading-7">
      Data stored by us for other purposes remains unaffected by this. After you
      unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address may
      be stored by us or the newsletter service provider in a blacklist if this
      is necessary to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist will
      only be used for this purpose and will not be merged with other data. This
      serves both your interest and our interest in complying with the legal
      requirements when sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the
      meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). Storage in the blacklist is not
      limited in time.<span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"> </span><b
