  "faq_question_10": "How precise is the AI in finding suitable funding?",
  "faq_answer_10": "Our AI doesn't just search for keywords, but analyzes your project description, industry, region, and other parameters to identify the most relevant funding opportunities. The more detailed your information, the more precise the results.",
  "faq_question_11": "How can I suggest funding programs not currently in your database?",
