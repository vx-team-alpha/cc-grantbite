# Project Brief: Funding Finder

## 1. Core Idea

Funding Finder aims to be a comprehensive, user-friendly portal aggregating public funding opportunities (grants, loans, subsidies, etc.) for businesses and research institutions across the European Union. It addresses the fragmentation and complexity of the current funding landscape by providing a single point of access with powerful search capabilities.

## 2. Problem Statement

- The current landscape of public funding in the EU (EU-level, national, regional, local) is highly fragmented across numerous portals.
- Existing portals are often difficult to navigate, lack effective search tools (mostly basic keyword search), and present information unclearly.
- Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) often lack the expertise and resources to navigate this complexity, missing out on relevant funding or requiring expensive consultants who may have limited scope.

## 3. Proposed Solution

A SaaS platform that:

- Aggregates funding programs from various sources (EU, national, regional, local).
- Prioritizes clarity, user-friendliness, and ease of use.
- Offers efficient search:
  - Keyword and advanced filtering.
  - AI-powered contextual search and guided querying.
  - Automated notifications for new relevant programs based on user profiles/searches.
- Provides clear summaries and direct links to original sources.
- Is multilingual (starting with German and English).

## 4. Target Audience

- Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) within the EU.
- Research institutions within the EU.
- Potentially funding consultants (as users or partners).

## 5. High-Level Goals & Scope (Initial Focus)

- Build upon the provided SvelteKit/Supabase/Stripe SaaS template (`CMSaasStarter`).
- Ingest and process data from initial sources, starting with the German Federal Funding Database (`FÃ¶rderdatenbank des Bundes`).
- Develop SEO-optimized public-facing pages for each funding program.
- Implement a robust keyword search functionality.
- Establish the core user authentication and account management features provided by the template.
- Set up the technical foundation for future expansion (multi-language, AI search, additional data sources, user portal features, monetization).

## 6. Key Success Metrics (Potential)

- Number of indexed funding programs.
- Organic search traffic and rankings for funding-related keywords.
- User registrations and engagement (e.g., saved searches, notifications set up).
- Conversion rates for potential future premium features or consultant leads.
- Data freshness and accuracy.
