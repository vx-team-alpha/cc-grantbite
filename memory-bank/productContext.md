# Product Context: Funding Finder

## 1. Problem Space

Navigating the European public funding landscape is a significant challenge for businesses and researchers. Key issues include:

- **Fragmentation:** Funding opportunities are scattered across numerous portals at EU, national, regional, and local levels.
- **Complexity:** Information is often presented in dense, bureaucratic language, making it hard to understand eligibility and application processes.
- **Inefficient Discovery:** Existing search tools are basic, often yielding irrelevant results and requiring significant manual effort to find suitable programs.
- **Resource Barrier:** SMEs, in particular, lack the time, expertise, and resources to effectively search for and apply for funding, often needing costly consultants.

## 2. Vision & Value Proposition

Funding Finder aims to become the go-to, centralized platform for discovering public funding in the EU. Its core value lies in:

- **Aggregation:** Bringing together diverse funding sources into one place.
- **Simplicity & Clarity:** Presenting complex information in an easily digestible format.
- **Efficiency:** Enabling users to quickly find relevant opportunities through powerful, intuitive search (including future AI capabilities).
- **Accessibility:** Lowering the barrier for SMEs and researchers to access funding information.

## 3. Target User Experience

- **Effortless Discovery:** Users should be able to find relevant funding programs with minimal friction, whether through keyword search, filters, or guided (future AI) queries.
- **Clear Information:** Program details should be presented concisely, highlighting key aspects like eligibility, funding amounts, deadlines, and application links.
- **Trustworthiness:** The platform must provide accurate, up-to-date information with clear links to official sources.
- **Proactive Assistance (Future):** Features like saved searches and notifications should help users stay informed about new opportunities automatically.
- **Multilingual:** The platform needs to cater to a diverse European audience, starting with German and English.

## 4. Monetization Strategy (Based on Roadmap)

While the initial focus is on building the core platform and attracting users (likely via SEO), potential future monetization includes:

- **Premium Subscription:** Offering enhanced features like faster notifications, advanced analytics, or saved profile matching.
- **Lead Generation:** Connecting users with qualified funding consultants for specific programs (commission-based).
- **Direct Consulting:** Offering in-house consulting services for selected programs/leads.
- **Value-Added Services:** Tools for collaboration, time tracking, documentation management related to funding applications.
